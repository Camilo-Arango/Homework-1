# Assignment-1
First Assignment:

We took code that was already provided, but made with bad form (all divs), and were asked to refactor it so that it was easier to follow. After cleaning up the HTML, the CSS needed to be reorganized and condensed as well since it had a lot of overlapping classes that were applied individually and also had things not being applied due to the changes of the HTML.

What we were left with is the same exact website, working as intended, but better optimized for search engines and legibility in case someone else wanted to look at the code and understand what is what.
